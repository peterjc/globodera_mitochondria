Raw data (read only once downloaded)
====================================

This folder holds raw data (e.g. Illumina reads from ENA) with scripts
to download and verify them (with a checksum), and thereafter they are
treated as read only for downstream analysis.

Note that due to its size, little (if any) of this raw data will be
checked into git - just the data fetching scripts and checksums will be.
